 * Two-layer XSS defense: the template HTML was already allow-list sanitized at
 * save time (`updateOnboardingEmailTemplate`), and here the token VALUES are
 * HTML-escaped before they land in the body — so an invitee-controlled name
 * can't inject markup and the link's query-string `&` becomes a valid `&amp;`
 * inside the href. The subject is plaintext (an email header, not HTML), so its
 * tokens are substituted raw — escaping would surface literal `&amp;` in the
 * inbox.
 *
 * `{{onboarding_link}}` is replaced before `{{employee_name}}` so a name that
 * happens to contain the link token is never re-expanded.
