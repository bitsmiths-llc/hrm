# HRM Screen Outlines (Content-First)

Level-1 fidelity per the prototype skill: what each screen must answer, before any
layout or code. Source of truth for scope is `Bitsmiths_HRM_PRD.pdf`; leave rule
confirmed 2026-07-06: 22-day pool = Paid + Sick + Half Day (0.5), Unpaid separate,
uncapped, only Unpaid prorates pay.

Build order: Slice 0 (shell + shared primitives) → Onboarding → Leave → Medical →
Overtime → Payroll → Policy & Contract + Admin dashboard home.
